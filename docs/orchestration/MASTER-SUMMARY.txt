================================================================================
CRITICAL PATH & TIMELINE
================================================================================

Current Time: 2026-02-06 08:55 UTC

Critical Path Sequence:
1. @dev fixes TypeScript errors (30-45 min) → ETA 09:40 UTC
2. @dev updates test mocks (20 min) → included in above
3. npm test runs (10 min) → target 418/418 passing
4. @po reviews & signs off (30 min) → 10:00-10:15 UTC
5. @architect completes design review (1-2 hours) → 10:00-11:00 UTC
6. @sm writes closure report (30 min) → after all gates pass
7. EPIC 2 merged to main → 10:15-10:30 UTC (once Gates 1-5 ✅)
8. EPIC 3 readiness confirmed → 11:00-11:30 UTC

Projected Key Milestones:
├─ @dev fixes complete: 09:40 UTC (45 min from now)
├─ All gates passing: 10:30 UTC (1.5 hours from now)
├─ EPIC 2 merged: 10:30 UTC (1.5 hours from now)
├─ @architect review complete: 11:00 UTC (2 hours from now)
├─ EPIC 3 ready to start: 11:30 UTC (2.5 hours from now)
└─ EPIC 3 sprint kickoff possible: Same day if schedule allows

================================================================================
IDENTIFIED RISKS & MITIGATIONS
================================================================================

CRITICAL RISKS:
1. TypeScript errors not fixable in 45 min
   ├─ Probability: MEDIUM
   ├─ Impact: CRITICAL (blocks merge)
   └─ Mitigation: @architect on standby for code review

2. Test pass rate cannot reach 95%
   ├─ Probability: MEDIUM
   ├─ Impact: CRITICAL (blocks merge)
   └─ Mitigation: @analyst investigates root cause

MEDIUM RISKS:
3. Architecture review extends > 2 hours
   ├─ Probability: MEDIUM
   ├─ Impact: HIGH (delays EPIC 3)
   └─ Mitigation: Start EPIC 3 design with assumptions

4. Product clarifications delayed > 1 hour
   ├─ Probability: LOW
   ├─ Impact: MEDIUM (delays EPIC 3 sprint)
   └─ Mitigation: Use default assumptions from AC

LOW RISKS:
5. Rate limiter typing fix takes longer
   ├─ Probability: LOW
   ├─ Impact: LOW (non-blocking)
   └─ Mitigation: Document as known issue, fix post-merge

================================================================================
GO/NO-GO CHECKPOINTS
================================================================================

Checkpoint 1: 09:30 UTC
├─ Gate: Have TypeScript errors been identified & fix approach confirmed?
├─ Expected: YES (or NO-GO)
└─ Action: Escalate to @architect if NO

Checkpoint 2: 10:00 UTC
├─ Gate: Have TypeScript errors been fixed & tests begun?
├─ Expected: npm build succeeds + npm test running
└─ Action: Identify additional blockers if NO

Checkpoint 3: 10:30 UTC
├─ Gate: Have all 5 quality gates begun to pass?
├─ Expected: Gates 1-5 passing or in progress
└─ Action: Identify which gates still blocked if any fail

Checkpoint 4: 11:00 UTC
├─ Gate: Ready to merge EPIC 2?
├─ Expected: Gates 1-5 all ✅ + sign-offs collected
└─ Action: Proceed to merge if YES, identify blockers if NO

Checkpoint 5: 11:30 UTC
├─ Gate: Ready to start EPIC 3?
├─ Expected: Merged + architecture reviewed + AC clarified
└─ Action: Kickoff EPIC 3 sprint if YES, schedule next checkpoint if NO
